# “Requirement Analysis in Software Development.”
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a crucial role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It ensures that software is built effectively, meets business needs, and avoids costly mistakes. Here are three key reasons why it is critical:

### 1. **Defines Clear Project Scope**
   Requirement Analysis helps teams establish a well-defined scope for the project. This prevents ambiguity and scope creep, ensuring that the development process stays on track without unnecessary changes or delays.

### 2. **Enhances Communication Between Stakeholders**
   By gathering and analyzing requirements, teams ensure that stakeholders—including clients, developers, and testers—have a shared understanding of what the software needs to achieve. This reduces misinterpretations and ensures alignment throughout the project.

### 3. **Reduces Development Costs and Risks**
   Identifying requirements early helps prevent costly revisions and defects later in the development process. Addressing potential issues at the requirement stage minimizes risks and ensures the final product meets business objectives efficiently.

By investing time in Requirement Analysis, teams set a strong foundation for a successful project, improving software quality and user satisfaction.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis is an essential phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), ensuring that software meets user needs and business objectives. Below are five key activities involved:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  - This step focuses on collecting information from stakeholders about their needs and expectations.  
  - Techniques such as interviews, surveys, and questionnaires help gather relevant data.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  - Involves refining and extracting more detailed insights beyond initial gathering.  
  - Techniques include brainstorming, prototyping, observations, and workshops.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  - Organizing and formalizing requirements into structured documents such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS).  
  - Ensures clear communication between stakeholders, developers, and testers.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  - Examining requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness.  
  - Using tools like UML diagrams, data flow diagrams, and process models to represent system behavior.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  - Ensures that documented requirements align with business goals and stakeholder expectations.  
  - Involves stakeholder review, prototype testing, and formal approval processes.

By following these activities, teams can build software with well-defined requirements, reducing the risk of costly errors during development.

## Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are categorized into two main types: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Both are essential in defining how a system should operate to meet user needs and business goals.

### 1. Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define the core features and operations of the system. They describe what the system must do to meet the needs of users and stakeholders.

#### **Examples for the Booking Management System**
- **User Registration** – The system must allow new users to sign up with an email and password.
- **Property Search** – Users must be able to search properties by location, price range, and availability.
- **Booking Confirmation** – After selecting a property, users should receive a booking confirmation via email.
- **Payment Processing** – The system must support secure online transactions using various payment methods.
- **Cancellation & Refund** – Users should have the ability to cancel bookings and request refunds based on predefined policies.

### 2. Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define the system's quality attributes, such as performance, security, usability, and scalability. They ensure the system operates efficiently and meets user expectations beyond just core functionalities.

#### **Examples for the Booking Management System**
- **Performance** – The system should process bookings in under two seconds.
- **Security** – User data must be encrypted, and secure login mechanisms should be implemented.
- **Scalability** – The system should support thousands of simultaneous users without performance degradation.
- **Usability** – The interface should be intuitive and accessible to users with different levels of technical expertise.
- **Reliability** – The system should maintain uptime of 99.9% to ensure continuous availability.

Understanding and clearly defining both functional and non-functional requirements helps teams build a robust booking management system that meets business objectives while delivering an optimal user experience.
